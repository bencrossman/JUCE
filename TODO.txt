Sampler
-Use DirectWave 1.6.3 to put DWP's in newer format
-Use Translator to convert to SF2's
-Use Polyphone to edit (good although no UI to change root note but there is source code). Need to mark Oneshots (Release to 100), velocity insensitive (Fixed velocity) and remove filters (Alto had one)
-Use https://github.com/Birch-san/juicysfplugin.git as basis
-Implement reverb (or maybe don't need to?)

Mac support missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-P8 - No Windows (Have fired off email))
-B4II - Old but just replace

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain 
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

If released
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solo - Visually mutes other zones
Notification of overrides (hide programs/banks)
Clear override (easy)
Load doesn't work
Need UI to enable/disable #CC16
Disconnect guitar on device change (stop ASIO4ALL crash), also if loading a guitar before others, will be active while loading.
Crash with empty scene and adding performance only?
After adding first song/setlist/performance going back to rack doesnt update titles
Option to select an image for plugin
"Select an image" texture

Future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Append onto Queen
Sampler Check octaves - Sampler treats midi channel 2 as separate intrument so in the case of octaved trumpets, PC should be set same for midi channel 1 and 2 etc...
Implement 16th
Tempo edit

Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Add new rack
Handle missing devices
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings
Jupiter 8
Support JV1080 - script presses button and saves out all patch states (This would give me a lot of new sounds)
Would be good to get Triton too

Non standard MIDI commands (use a single MidiFilter)
Transition Keylab Sysex to JUCE Midi Out (Will only work on device)

Chunk saving (M1 users presets especially Two Part, OPX Famous bank, DirectWave setup, Wavstreamer setup)
Check sampler supports octave mode

Maybe support for M1 Combi (Show must go on)

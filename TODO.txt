Creator bug : Where GraphEditorPanel::changeListenerCallback sometimes fires randomly and on save. Can't just check for changed. OnLoad fires multiple times and if added support for non setlist performances then would just lose local changes
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted)

Next time rack removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack", delete all zones

If releaseed
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rename rack
Reorder racks

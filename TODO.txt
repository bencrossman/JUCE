Setlist manager (So can change set at gig)
- Have an auto setlist of all songs
- "Use" applies to "All songs", "Performances in selected song", "Performances"
- If Performance isnt in current setlist then switch to auto setlist
Rename cancel

For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upgrade to JUCE 6
- Use their midi output
- Use their gain plugin
Append onto Queen
Sampler Check octaves - Sampler treats midi channel 2 as separate intrument so in the case of octaved trumpets, PC should be set same for midi channel 1 and 2 etc...
Implement 16th
Tempo edit

Future
~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Add new rack
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings
Support JV1080 - script presses button and saves out all patch states (This would give me a lot of new sounds)
Would be good to get Triton too

64bit upgrade:
- FM7 (would need to try FM8)
- DirectWave
- OPX (didn't work 1.1 is 32bit, higher versions don't save entire bank and dont report patch names)
- B4 II (Doesn't come in 64 bit, would need to try other plugins)


Runtime bug - Hold last radio patch and change to break free
Perhaps map modulation to CC16 (for unknown midi keyboards)
Disco Strings / Guitar should just have no patch dropdown

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)

Creator bug : Where GraphEditorPanel::changeListenerCallback sometimes fires randomly - Need to repro so keep break point there
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

Next time rack removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack", delete all zones

If released
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rename rack
Reorder racks
Need UI to enable/disable #CC3

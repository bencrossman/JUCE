Current setlist
Some devices renamed?

Setlist manager (see below - So can change set at gig)



For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sampler Check octaves - Sampler treats midi channel 2 as separate intrument so in the case of octaved trumpets, PC should be set same for midi channel 1 and 2 etc...
Implement 16th
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Add new rack

Future
~~~~~~
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings
Support JV1080 - script presses button and saves out all patch states

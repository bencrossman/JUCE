-1 on claps program

Import chunk data - Need to test JUCE state save on OPX is whole bank

Song/Scene index? (This might be a import to xml thing? No because we'll add more songs during edit)
Chunk saving (M1 users presets especially Two Part, OPX Famous bank, DirectWave setup, Wavstreamer setup)

Check sampler supports octave mode
Mono switch (simply takes left of TruePianos)
M1 needs to share VST instance (Because defaults to Combi mode, Still will have two racks though)
Song change - Check resends Bank/Program
Saving
Setlist manager
Maybe some refactoring

Scoops/Falls for disco strings
Maybe support for M1 Combi (Show must go on)
TruePianos crash

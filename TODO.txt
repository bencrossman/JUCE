Hardware
- Aerials back
- One of the 1/4" channel contact points
- ASIO4ALL doesnt show inputs on laptop (seems to work on NUC though - Windows 11?)
- WASAPI errors on input on laptop with new LINK2 with all combinations. Weird
- Fine with BEHRINGER but with WASAPI exclusive only 
- BEHRINGER with laptop on WASAPI sounds great
- Selecting input on laptop crashes unless you remove racks on load (I had to do this on NUC anyway)
- Guitar has directional noise problem anyway
- Both LINKS have noise problems although NUC may be worse.
- Laptop guitar tone (thru WASAPI) seems stronger than NUC's - I wonder if the switch is reversed (the volume is)

Software
- Guitar plugin needs Internet - Show stopper for now, although not reproducable.
- Arpegio not triggering
- If device not found dont save blank
- OBX - 3oclock on old hp, full on NUC - Do a pass on all Queen songs
- Final countdown too loud
- Kinda magic bells?
- Love of my life strings (make simpler or reduce volume)
- Best friend maybe too loud (compare)
- Somebody 2nd patch organ really loud (not touch?)


Song improvements (do a full pass):

-Choir at end!
-I want it all bridge, more sounds up keyboard
-Crazy little thing called love, try and get preample in
-More BV triggers?

Start upgrading all plugins to 64bit (Probably not TruePianos, B3? DX7? DirectWave? Mine first, P8 possibly, OBX but might be with some patch conversion)

Implement audio in

Remap pads on MKII, off to 0x1E, maybe filter other sliders and knobs

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings?

Creator bug : Where GraphEditorPanel::changeListenerCallback sometimes fires randomly - Need to repro so keep break point there
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

Next time rack removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack", delete all zones

If releaseed
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rename rack
Reorder racks
Need UI to enable/disable #CC3

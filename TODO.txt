Do non UI stuff
- Per zone SF2 reverb


Mac support missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-P8 - No Windows (Have fired off email), Used 3,6,7,13,14,21,22,24,30,31,39,41,45,55,59
-B4II - Old but just replace

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Brass volumes will be wrong
Use Polyphone to edit: Need to mark Oneshots (Release to 100), Velocity insensitive (Fixed velocity), Remove filters (Alto had one), Reverb, Watch out for panning when mixing mono samples

Police - 1 song - King Of Pain 
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, ditch a lot of the vocal samples
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch), alot of samples got lost.

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Per zone SF2 reverb

TruePianos/Jupiter8 also doesnt do sounds off. Could add a tail monitor before bypass.



If released
~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes racks arnt expanded when active (Go through Queen setlist)
Solo - Visually mutes other zones
Notification of global/overrides (hide programs/banks)
Clear override (easy)
Load doesn't work, also doesn't clear previous causing crash
Need UI to enable/disable #CC16
Disconnect guitar on device change (stop ASIO4ALL crash), also if loading a guitar before others, will be active while loading.
Crash with empty scene and adding performance only? Yes if no setlist
After adding first song/setlist/performance going back to rack doesnt update titles
Option to select an image for plugin
"Select an image" texture
WavStreamer/SoundFontPlayer needs to refresh on dropdown

Future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hang over notes from previous patch
Jam mode?

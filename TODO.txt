Buy Amplitude

Plugins
~~~~~~~
I don't like internet licenses because worry about legacy support
What currently uses licenses that require Internet check (These are also the 64 bit ones except P8):
-Truepianos (Why not, always have old version to full back on)
-Korg (because just couldn't find Triton hacked but have M1/WS old versions to fall back on)

Mac support
~~~~~~~~~~~
-No Superwave P8
-OPX wont be 1.1 (does patches well)
-Would have to hunt for B4II / FM7 / JV1080 / Jupiter 8 / DirectWave but shouldnt be afraid to just buy

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Append onto Queen
- Combine sampler (hard code)
- Append .performer
- Set appegiator modes to all 16th (hard code)
- Put brass in Samples?

Sampler Check octaves - Sampler treats midi channel 2 as separate intrument so in the case of octaved trumpets, PC should be set same for midi channel 1 and 2 etc...
Implement 16th
Tempo edit
Possible volume init bug? Too quiet?
Possible midi bug on 2nd song

Future
~~~~~~
Integrate for Access database with edit?
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Rename rack
Reorder racks
Handle missing devices
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings

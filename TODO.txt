-Replacement for DirectWave (my own - would then be Mac compatible?) or https://www.tx16wx.com/ (free)
 Needs velocity ranges, creation UI, reverb, velcoity ignore, one shot, program changes
 https://github.com/Birch-san/juicysfplugin.git could be good basis
 Need to convert dwp files. Chicken Systems Translator doesn't seem to use the wav files. Could try resaving dwp's and translater again
 Start with DiscoStrings / Brass
 


Plugin licensing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I don't like internet licenses because worry about legacy support
What currently uses licenses that require Internet check:
-Truepianos (Always have old version to full back on but actually might not need Internet)
-Korg (because just couldn't find Triton hacked but have M1/WS old versions to fall back on)
-Amplitube (Also have old version to fall back on)

Mac support missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-OPX (Crash if set state too quick, State only saved of current preset and number is 1 [Shame because does respond to PC's], No names saved or can be queried). Would have to simply use as state plugin (or extreme write a script to cycle through / dump / get names from opxbank file - would be hard to maintain)
-DirectWave (Fruityloops but bug with PC send, support ticket logged)
-Won't be able to get P8 (Windows only - Have fired off email)) / B4II(Old)

B4II notes
~~~~~~~~~~
Looks like I changed the following from default on patch 1:
- Pedal bass sliders all up
- Treble rotor spread up max
- Bass rotor distance down min
- Rotorer run not set to "T" mode
- All CC's assigned (although probably doesn't do anything)

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

If released
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solo - Visually mutes other zones
Notification of overrides (hide programs/banks)
Clear override (easy)
Load doesn't work
Need UI to enable/disable #CC16
Disconnect guitar on device change (stop ASIO4ALL crash)
Crash with empty scene and adding performance only?
After adding first song/setlist/performance going back to rack doesnt update titles
Option to select an image for plugin
"Select an image" texture

Future features

VST specific was something to do with import I think (13/1/20)

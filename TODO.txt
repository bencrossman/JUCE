Setlist manager (see below - So can change set at gig)
 Exactly like Forte but split 3 lists into two screen of 2 lists
Have auto setlist for all songs in alphabetical order
 
For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upgrade to JUCE 6
- Use their midi output
- Use their gain plugin
Append onto Queen
Sampler Check octaves - Sampler treats midi channel 2 as separate intrument so in the case of octaved trumpets, PC should be set same for midi channel 1 and 2 etc...
Implement 16th

Future
~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Add new rack
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings
Support JV1080 - script presses button and saves out all patch states (This would give me a lot of new sounds)
Would be good to get Triton too

Additional Queen import tasks (won't need this soon since all data imported will be valid)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Load my famous OPX bank, Learn #3 to Filter Envelope D 
- M1 set to prog mode, global midi channel 1
- Show must go on override including transpose
- Delete the Show must go on "end" performances
- PC 0 on WavStreamer unmuted before Borap middle (Can't remember if this is actually only a Forte thing)

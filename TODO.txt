IPlugins
~~~~~~~
I don't like internet licenses because worry about legacy support
What currently uses licenses that require Internet check:
-Truepianos (Why not, always have old version to full back on)
-Korg (because just couldn't find Triton hacked but have M1/WS old versions to fall back on)
-Amplitube (Also have old version to fall back on)

Mac support
~~~~~~~~~~~
-No Superwave P8
-OPX wont be 1.1 (does patches well)
-Won't be able to find B4II / FM7(FM8?) / DirectWave

Bugs
~~~~
First load, banks always visible


Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

Capitalize song names?
Decide what do do about songs in non original keys.

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings

Bug where GraphEditorPanel::changeListenerCallback sometimes fires randomly and on save. Can't just check for changed. OnLoad fires multiple times and if added support for non setlist performances then would just lose local changes

Bug where M1 bank is fine but shows patch list from previous (Wavestation at least)

Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted)

Bug - switching back to setlist if non setlist performance selected

Next time rack removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack", delete all zones

If releaseed
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rename rack
Reorder racks

Possibly a sort bug
Check history

Plugins
~~~~~~~
I don't like internet licenses because worry about legacy support
What currently uses licenses that require Internet check:
-Truepianos (Always have old version to full back on but actually might not need Internet)
-Korg (because just couldn't find Triton hacked but have M1/WS old versions to fall back on)
-Amplitube (Also have old version to fall back on)

Mac support (And next release)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Roland AU's would need presets all redumped
-Korg M1/WS isn't reporting program names (Just do what I did for Triton)
-OPX wont handle program changes and names
-Won't be able to get P8 (Windows only) / B4II(Old) / DirectWave(Old, buy latest has no VST)

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

If released
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Load doesn't work
Need UI to enable/disable #CC16
Disconnect guitar on device change (stop ASIO4ALL crash)
After adding first song/setlist/performance going back to rack doesnt update titles
Option to select an image for plugin
"Select an image" texture

Future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hang over notes from previous patch

For covers / Blondie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Append onto Queen
- Check samplier reverb (especially brass types)

Possible random bypass bug
Bug - Use "That's the way - Rips" picks piano?

Future
~~~~~~
Integrate for Access database with edit?
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Rename rack
Reorder racks
Handle missing devices
Implement scoops / falls for disco strings
Jupiter 8
Support JV1080 - script presses button and saves out all patch states (This would give me a lot of new sounds)
Triton - Patch names (Extract from dll)

-Replacement for DirectWave, Needs velocity ranges, creation UI, reverb, velcoity ignore, one shot, program changes

Translator
-'Oneshot' lost (for EXS and no support in SF2)
-EXS exports seem to have region/att set to -60db, Logic 9.1+ fixes this
-Can only convert DWP's from version 1.6.3
-Exports a filter (on Alto Express at least)

My own
-Mac and future proof
-Use https://github.com/Birch-san/juicysfplugin.git as basis
-Polyphone good although no UI to change root note
 
TX16WX
-Kinda free, Mac, text format and streaming too
-Can't work out how to set root without typing it in first
-Various UI bugs
-Over complicated with regions(streaming defaults to DFD which is stupid, OUT set to FX1 for reverb), groups(has oneshot), programs, sounds('release' doesn't import from SF2, 'fixed velocity' doesn't import from SF2[as velocity sensitivity=0] and doesn't import whatever EXS would use[although the way I do it post volume is crap])
-Reverb(damp is percent rather then frequency, no decay, wet is probably send) 
 
-Look at integrating Guitar plugin into code [great because doesn't have UI anyway and brings guitar to Mac] (and sampler & streamer if tx16wx no good)

Mac support missing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DirectWave (Fruityloops but bug with PC send, support ticket logged, also options above)
-P8 - No Windows (Have fired off email))
-B4II - Old but just replace

Next cover band
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Police - 1 song - King Of Pain 
Dire Straits - 4 songs
John Farnham(Still loads in Forte) - 5 songs, Voice already done
Pink Floyd - 11 songs, Brick already done (On the run is OBX patch)
Bon Jovi - 15 songs, Living Prayer already done (runaway is OBX patch)
Pink(Still loads in Forte) - 20 performances, 
Madonna - 23 performances (Borderline is OPX patch)

Integrate for Access database with edit? (library linked already)
Creator bug : Definitely some "solo" bugs (i.e. play with solo, change patch, plugin not set or playing even though highlighted) - Cant repro at the moment

If released
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solo - Visually mutes other zones
Notification of overrides (hide programs/banks)
Clear override (easy)
Load doesn't work
Need UI to enable/disable #CC16
Disconnect guitar on device change (stop ASIO4ALL crash), also if loading a guitar before others, will be active while loading.
Crash with empty scene and adding performance only?
After adding first song/setlist/performance going back to rack doesnt update titles
Option to select an image for plugin
"Select an image" texture

Future features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hang over notes from previous patch

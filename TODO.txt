BACKUP READY! Don't need to bring Windows 7 laptops to Sydney. Look at Windows 10 backup PC (NUC2?)

Sampler Check octaves (can't remember what this means but must be covers for now, might be as simple as the crazy patches that use 4 samplers [2 octaved intruments])

Setlist manager (see below)
Mono switch (simply takes left of TruePianos)
Implement right click menu item "Delete rack"
Add new rack

For covers
~~~~~~~~~~
Implement 16th

Future

Setlists/Songs

Exactly like Forte but split 3 lists into two screen of 2 lists
Have option to select any performance on rack screen (will say unassigned)

Additional import tasks

- M1 set to prog mode, global midi channel 1
- Show must go on override including transpose
